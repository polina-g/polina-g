# Hi there 👋  My name is Polina! 

## About Me
##### Welcome to my Github page. A little about me: I am a software developer who loves to learn and has a strong passion for coding, problem solving and helping create bigger and better things. My decision to change careers has been the most challenging, but also one of the most rewarding thus far. I take the empathy, ability to listen to others and willingness to always learn with me as I transition from clinical psychology into the tech industry. Coding gives me new languages and tools to positively impact those around me and I am excited to continue building meaningful solutions to complex problems. I believe in working hard at achieving your goals and I aspire to never stop learning, growing and being better tomorrow than I am today.

## Some things to know about me:
- :computer: **_I LOVE to code:_** Whether it's in the front end or back end, working on a passion project or for a job, creating someting new or debugging an existing problem - I will love every second of it.
- **_I am very dedicated:_** Switching careers was not an easy task. For me it meant working nights and weekends for many months to get to where I am today. I would not take back a single minute of that time - it is very well worth it in the end.
- **_I love to learn new technologies:_** I have learned a lot since the day I wrote my first line of code, and I know there is A LOT more out there. I am truly excited to soak in every bit of information that I can and grow my skills as a developer. 
- **_I am here to stay:_** Switching careers has been 100% the best decision I ever made for myself.
